This is an important result that enables Razor to utilize The Chase to construct homomorphically minimal models of a given first-order theory. In the context of a model-finding application, the models that The Chase produces are desirable since they contain minimum amount of information, thus they induce minimal distraction. As a direct consequence of semi-decidability of satisfiability in first-order logic (see Gödel's incompleteness theorems ), satisfiability of geometric theories is semi-decidable as well.

Indeed, because of this defining moment in his future, Wyllis became Hodor in his past. Linear Time The theory below describes Hodor's journey assuming that time progresses linearly hodor-linear.raz // Wyllis hears \"Hold the Door\" (at time `t`), then he becomes Hodor in the next\n// point of time\nHoldTheDoor(t) -> Hodor(next(t)); // Hodor, after turning into Hodor at time \"t\", holds the Door at some time \"tt\"\n// in future (\"tt > t\")\nHodor(t) -> ? tt .

We can restrict the size of the structures constructed by Razor by bounding the number of their elements. For example, if we restrict the number of elements to 4, Razor will find 9 incomplete structures, which do not satisfy the theory: razor solve -i theories/examples/hodor-linear.raz --bound domain=4 For example, the following structure corresponds to an incomplete model where e#0 denotes the starting point t_hodor and e#1 , e#2 and e#4 are other points in time: Domain: e#0, e#2, e#4, e#1 Elements: 't_hodor -> e#0, sk#0[e#0] -> e#1, next[e#0], sk#1[e#0, e#1] -> e#2,\nnext[e#1] -> e#4 Facts: After(e#0, e#1), After(e#2, e#1), Hodor(e#0), Hodor(e#4), HoldTheDoor(e#1) Now consider e#1 and e#2 . The incomplete model shows that e#1 is after e#2 , but neither e#1 immediately follows e#2 (no next point for e#2 ) nor there exists a point that is after e#2 and before e#1 , violating the second rule of linear time progression. In general, it may be possible to extend the incomplete structure to a model of the theory by adding more information to the model. Any model of this particular theory, however, is infinitely large. Time-Loop Next, we model time as a \"big ball of wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff!\" To make it simple, let's assume that time-loops can only happen at the moment that Hodor heard a voice from the future, namely 't_hodor , changing our rules of time progression ( hodor-time-loop.raz ): HoldTheDoor(t) -> Hodor(next(t)); Hodor(t) -> ? tt . HoldTheDoor(tt) & After(t, tt); next(t0) = t1 -> After(t0, t1);\nAfter(t0, t1) -> (next(t0) = t1) | ? t2 . next(t0) = t2 & After(t2, t1); // Hold the door moment only happens at 't_hodor\nHoldTheDoor(t) -> t = 't_hodor; Hodor('t_hodor); In presence of time-loops, Razor can explain Hodor's curious journey: razor solve -i theories/examples/hodor-time-loop.raz This time, Razor produces infinitely many (finite) models with time-loops of different size.
